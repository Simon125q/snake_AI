# Snake AI

This project is an implementation of an artificial intelligence that plays the classic Snake game. It is developed in Python and utilizes the PyTorch library to implement a Q-learning model. The AI learns optimal game strategies over time through reinforcement learning.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create an AI that can learn to play and excel at the Snake game autonomously. By using a Q-learning model, the AI improves its performance through continuous interaction with the game environment, adjusting its strategy based on rewards received for eating food and penalties for hitting walls or itself.

## Demonstrations

### Initial Performance

At the beginning of training, the AI's movements are largely random as it starts to understand the game dynamics.

### Performance After Short Training

After a few training sessions, the AI begins to develop a basic understanding of the game, avoiding walls and starting to chase food more effectively.

## Lessons Learned

This project was a valuable learning experience in several ways:
- **Reinforcement Learning Application**: It provided practical experience in applying reinforcement learning algorithms to solve problems in a dynamic environment.
- **Algorithm Tuning**: I learned how to tune parameters to optimize the learning rate and performance of the AI.
- **Problem-Solving and Debugging**: Developing the AI required innovative problem-solving and continuous debugging to improve its decision-making capabilities.
- **Persistence and Iterative Improvement**: The iterative nature of the project taught me the importance of persistence and incremental improvements in achieving good AI performance.

## Conclusion

The Snake AI project not only enhanced my skills in Python and PyTorch but also deepened my understanding of machine learning concepts, particularly in the field of reinforcement learning. It was a challenging yet rewarding project that pushed the boundaries of my analytical and programming abilities.
